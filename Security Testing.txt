What is Security Testing?
Security Testing is a type of Software Testing that uncovers vulnerabilities, threats, risks in a software application and prevents malicious attacks from intruders. The purpose of Security Tests is to identify all possible loopholes and weaknesses of the software system which might result in a loss of information, revenue, repute at the hands of the employees or outsiders of the Organization.

Why Security Testing is Important?
The main goal of Security Testing is to identify the threats in the system and measure its potential vulnerabilities, so the threats can be encountered and the system does not stop functioning or can not be exploited. It also helps in detecting all possible security risks in the system and helps developers to fix the problems through coding.

Goal of Security Testing: The goal of security testing is to:

To identify the threats in the system.
To measure the potential vulnerabilities of the system.
To help in detecting every possible security risks in the system.
To help developers in fixing the security problems through coding.
Principle of Security Testing: Below are the six basic principles of security testing:

Confidentiality
Integrity
Authentication
Authorization
Availability
Non-repudiation

Major Focus Areas in Security Testing:
Network Security
System Software Security
Client-side Application Security
Server-side Application Security

Types of security:

Vulnerability Scanning: This is done through automated software to scan a system against known vulnerability signatures.

Security Scanning: It involves identifying network and system weaknesses, and later provides solutions for reducing these risks. This scanning can be performed for both Manual and Automated scanning.

Penetration testing: This kind of testing simulates an attack from a malicious hacker. This testing involves analysis of a particular system to check for potential vulnerabilities to an external hacking attempt.

Risk Assessment: This testing involves analysis of security risks observed in the organization. Risks are classified as  Low, Medium and High. This testing recommends controls and measures to reduce the risk.

Security Auditing: This is an internal inspection of Applications and Operating systems for security flaws. An audit can also be done via line by line inspection of code

Ethical hacking: It’s hacking an Organization Software systems. Unlike malicious hackers, who steal for their own gains, the intent is to expose security flaws in the system.

Posture Assessment: This combines Security scanning, Ethical Hacking and Risk Assessments to show an overall security posture of an organization.
